snappy
======

snappy is a backup program for managing rsync based snapshots.

To check out the most recent release, type:
  git clone git://github.com/guppy/snappy.git

Usage
=====

  snappy [-c config file or dir] interval

-c: the configuration file or directory (will default to a few locations if not specified)
interval: hourly, daily, or weekly

example:

  snappy -c snappy.conf hourly

If you ran that every 4 hours via cron, you would end up with directories named
hourly.0 to hourly.5, each of which contain a complete snapshot of whatever 
backups you specified in that configuration file.

Requirements
============

rsync >= 2.5.6
python >= 2.4

A destination volume that can handle doing hard-links.
