snappy
======

snappy is a backup program for managing rsync based snapshots.

To check out the most recent release, type:
  git clone git://github.com/guppy/snappy.git

Usage
=====

  snappy -n N interval source destination

-n: the number of copies to keep
interval: hourly, daily, or weekly
source: any source argument you would normally pass to rsync
destination: the destination directory that already exists

example:

  snappy -n 6 hourly root@example.com:/home /mnt/backups/example.com/home

If you ran that every 4 hours via cron, you would end up with directories named
hourly.0 to hourly.5, each of which contain a complete snapshot of
example.com's /home filesystem.

Requirements
============

rsync >= 2.5.6
python >= 2.4

A destination volume that can handle doing hard-links.
